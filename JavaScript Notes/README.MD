* Started the course **Learn Form Validation by Building a Calorie Counter** here I'll learn basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.
* Shorthand Notes:
    - Learned about innerHTML
    - Regex (Regular Expressions)
    - .match() method
    - Template Literals **${}**

* Started the course **Learn Basic String and Array Methods by Building a Music Player** learn some essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), and join(). These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications..
* Shorthand Notes:
    - To create empty Array **const/let allSongs = [];**
    - To create a property in an object/array use : after the property name example **currentSong: null,**
    - Arrow functions, arrow functions is an anonymous function expression and a shorter way to write functions **() => {}**
    - Named Arrow function example **const exampleFunction = () => {// code goes here}**
    - To interpolate something means put **${}** that around your text
    - To call something just type the name followed by () brackets for example. renderSongs()
    - Strictly equal means using 3 x = in code to check someting **===**
    - Strictly NOT equal **!==**
    - This is known as OR/IF **||**

    * Continued the course **Learn Basic String and Array Methods by Building a Music Player** learn some essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), and join(). These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications..
    * Shorthand Notes:
        - The **createTextNode()** method is used to create a text node.
        - **appendChild()** lets you add a node or an element as the child of another element.
        - **DOM** DOM stands for Document Object Model
        - The **forEach** method is used to loop through an array and perform a function on each element of the array.
        - The **indexOf()** array method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if the element is not present.

* Started new course **Learn the Date Object by Building a Date Formatter** this project will cover concepts such as the **getDate()**, **getMonth()**, and **getFullYear()** methods.
* Shorthand Notes:
    - ` ` is used to create an empty template literals. For example **const formattedDate = ``**
    - To add embedded expression in a template literal use **${ }** inside your two backticks known as an empty template literal.
    - A switch statement is used to compare an expression against multiple possible values and execute different code blocks based on the match. It's commonly used for branching logic. 
    For example: **switch (dateOptionsSelectElement.value) { };* The "EXPRESSION" goes in between the brackets. 
    - The *split()* method is used to divide a string into substrings based on a specified separator. It then returns these substrings as elements of an array.
    For example: **const exampleSentence = "selur pmaCedoCeerf".split();**
    To add an empty string as a separator to the split method use "" in the brackets. For example: **const exampleSentence = "selur pmaCedoCeerf".split("");**
    - Chain the reverse method to your split method.
    For example: **const exampleSentence = "selur pmaCedoCeerf".split("").reverse();**
    - To chain methods just use fullstop then the methods for example: **const exampleSentence = "selur pmaCedoCeerf".split("").reverse().join("");**
    - The *break* statement will tell the JavaScript interpreter to stop executing statements. Without adding a break statement at the end of each case block, the program will execute the code for all matching cases. Just simply type **break;** at the end of your code.

* Started new course **Learn Modern JavaScript Methods by Building Football Team Cards** This project will cover concepts like switch statements, default parameters, Object.freeze(), the map() method, and more.
* Shorthand Notes:
    - To access an element in HTML with Java use the getElementById for example **const teamName = document.getElementById("team")** and you must always use DOCUMENT before the getElementById to access from the HTML DOCUMENT.
    - When adding properties to const you'll add them like this for exampple **team: "Argentina"** but when you add property with numbers for example **year: 1992** you dont use quotations arounf the numbers only around the words
