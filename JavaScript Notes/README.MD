* Started the course **Learn Basic String and Array Methods by Building a Music Player** learn some essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), and join(). These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications..
* Shorthand Notes:
    - To create empty Array **const/let allSongs = [];**
    - To create a property in an object/array use : after the property name example **currentSong: null,**
    - Arrow functions, arrow functions is an anonymous function expression and a shorter way to write functions **() => {}**
    - Named Arrow function example **const exampleFunction = () => {// code goes here}**
    - To interpolate something means put **${}** that around your text
    - To call something just type the name followed by () brackets for example. renderSongs()
    - Strictly equal means using 3 x = in code to check someting **===**
    - Strictly NOT equal **!==**
    - This is known as OR/IF **||**

        - The **createTextNode()** method is used to create a text node.
        - **appendChild()** lets you add a node or an element as the child of another element.

        - The **forEach** method is used to loop through an array and perform a function on each element of the array.
        - The **indexOf()** array method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if the element is not present.
